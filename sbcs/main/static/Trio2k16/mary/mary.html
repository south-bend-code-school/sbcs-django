    <h2 style= "font-family: 'Amatic SC', cursive;">Me, Myself, and I</h2>
    </div>
    <p>My name is Mary M., and I go to Marian High School. I live in Michigan, I used to have a pet snapping turtle. No idea why that's relevant, but let's keep the ball rolling. I have anxiety and depression, I sort of like poetry, and I am very sarcastic. Go visit @mylifeafterwards.weebly.com, the admin is a friend of mine (she's really cool). I got into coding because it's a skill that is easy to learn, and there are plenty of employment opporunities that come with it. I don't have many friends, so I embed myself in school or employment and all that jazz. This site is mostly for me to just talk about issues and things that are important to me, stupid as that sees.</p>

    <h2 style= "font-family:'Amatic SC',cursive;">Fun Facts</h2>
    </div>
    <p>1. I have a brother (well, technically, I have like, four, but that's unimportant). 2. I play several instruments (flute, guitar, piano, etc.). 3. I consider myself a feminist. 4. I am pro-choice, and anti-gun control. 5. I am terrible at french. </p>

    <h2 style= "font-family:'Amatic SC',cursive;">Traits I Admire About Myself</h2>
    </div>
    <p>I don't really have anything I admire about myself.</p>
    <div style= "background-color:lightseagreen; text-align:center; border: 5px solid black;">
    <h2 style= "font-family:'Amatic SC',cursive;">Goals (like, literally)</h2>
    </div>
    <p>I don't have any goals. I want to do well in school, but it's not as important as some of the other things happenening in my life. I've got actual, real problems happening, and I don't exactly have all the time in the world to deal with maintaining a social life or extra curriculars. I just want to make or do something I can run with, and be able to provide for myself, and with coding, that's a real possibility.</p>
    <div style= "background-color:lightseagreen; text-align:center; border: 5px solid black;">
    <h2 stlye= "font-family:'Amatic SC',cursive;">Politics</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Told you I'd get into the politics. So, half my family is Republican, the other side is Democratic. I consider myself to be Independant. On my Dad's side (without getting into detail), we train our children to defend themselves, whether it be through firearms, blades, archery, or martial arts, we ensure that this family is ready. Call us paranoid, but it's worked so far. On my mother's side, the only way to learn how to use weaponry is to go into the military. And if you look at the statistics, the average amount of gun usage in self defense is 2,533,760;m whereas the amount of gun violence used in armed robberies, suicides, shootings, murders, etc., is less than 32,000. If that doesn't sway you, look at it this way: there are 794,300 total police officers in the United states. There are 80,000,000 armed citizens. Police have an 11% error rate; armed citizens have a two percent error rate. There's an average of over 14 lives lost in shooting stopped by police; with armed citizens, only about 2.</p>

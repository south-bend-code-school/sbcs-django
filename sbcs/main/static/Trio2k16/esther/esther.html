 <h1 style="text-align:center;">About Me</h1>
  <img style= "margin-left:495px; padding-right:10px; height: 200px" src="http://www.theshinjukueffect.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/NeoAfricanGoddess-feature1-1038x576.jpg">
<h2 style="font-size:25px; text-align:center;font-family: 'Lobster Two', cursive;">Esther Wanjiru Ndungu</h2>
 <p style="text-align:center;">Starting off, welcome to my world! My name is Esther Ndungu, I'm a 16 years old girl, and I attend John Adams High School. I'm from Kenya,
 which is in the eastern region in Africa. I moved to the states when I was 1 years old. With nothing but clothes in our suitcase, and dreams in our pocket, my parents only had hope that one day my brother and I could be successful in this great land of America. My dream after I graduate form high school is to go to Washington University and study Neuroscience, and become a Pediatric Neurosurgeon. Curently, I am working on two of my organizations in Kenya, Which is called "EAG" (East African Girl/Guy), which is meant for young high school students like me learn more about entreprenuership, and how it can help grow and expand our great Kenya. "Nakupenda" (I Love You), is for women with children, and elders, who are very low finacially and economically, help them get back on their feet and conquer the world. Other than that I'm looking forward to exploring and finding out more abot my world!</p>
 
 
 
 <h1 style="text-align:center;">Places I've Visited</h1>
 <p style="text-align:center;">I had the opportunity to vist and travel to places like: London, Qatar,
 Dubai, Germany, Switzerland, Tanzania, Sweden, and of course Kenya.
 I've come to embrace, and learn to love new culture ouside of my own,
 and became more knowledgeable about the history and backround of these
 countries.</p>




<h1 style="text-align:center;">Hobbies</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">This might sound really weird, but I love to get lost in the woods. Just walking into a land of trees,
glistening with surrounding water, and letting my mind run loose is the most peaceful thing to me.
I also love to do hair on myself as well as on other people. Another thing is that I can speak 5 different language, that are all in the region of Kenya. I also like to
play soccer on my free time and read when it's my "lay-back-and-relax" time.</p>
 
 
 
<h1 style="text-align:center;">Life Goals</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"> IBefore I turn 18, I want to have created, and successfully establish my organizations, as well as
become an ambassador of a major organization in the southern region of Africa. I want to have owned my own Hospital in Kenya, as well as build malls in Nairobi,Kenya. By the age of 36 I want to have already obtained my Doctorate Degree in Neuroscience and become a Pediatric Surgeon. Overall, I want to have achived my goeals, and learn more who I am as an individual, and contribute my talents into helping this world.</p>

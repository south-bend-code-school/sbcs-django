  <h4>Enjoying my college visit at Columbia University in New York</h4>

  <h2 style="color:maroon; font-color:30px; text-align:center;">About Me</h2>
  <p>I am from South Bend, Indiana, and currently am a full IB senior at John Adams High School.</p>
  <h2 style="color:maroon">Fun Facts</h2>
  <p> I am the older sister of Melany Morales and Daniella Morales and the daughter of Carlos Morales and Maria Garibay. I love to play tennis and dance in my free time, and also like to volunteer at around my community. I also love traveling with my family around the country and Mexico. </p>
  <h2 style="color:maroon">My Involvement in the Community and School</h2>
  <p>I am currently secretary for my National Honors Society, am part of the International Student Organization, JAVA (Volunteer Assocation), John Adams Girls Tennis, and Upward Bound at the University of Notre Dame. I recently have also obtained an internship at a local law firm called Monterrosa Law Group, and am also an INCPAS scholar. </p>
  <h2 style="color:maroon"> My Favorite Places to go </h2>
  <p> I love to shop, so one can always catch me at the mall or the outlet mall in Michigan City. I also love traveling to Mexico, since I get to not only visit my grandmothers, but also get to explore different landmarks around the country.  </p>
  <h2 style="color:maroon"> What I love and Advocate</h2>
    <p> I personally love to volunteer around the community, especially in areas where my help is concentrated on helping people who do not have access to many opportunities in the community. I also am very concerned about the entire immigration reform currently being put into consideration in the nation, and by this sparked interest I have been inspired to become a lawyer and perhaps one day have say in these reforms.  </p>
   <h2 style="color:maroon"> Traits I Admire most about myself </h2>
   <p> I am a self-motivated, hard-driven, and ambitious student. I'm always looking for inmprovement in myself, and am determined to accomplish my goals. </p>
   <h2 style="color:maroon"> My Goals </h2>
   <p> My goal is to attend either the University of Notre Dame, Colombia University in NY, or Yale University and major in pre-law, poltical science or business. I am sure than I want to pursue a law degree, so I plan on attending law school right after obtaining my bachelor's degree. I hope to one day become a lawyer and specialize in corporate law and immigration and also own my own law firm. By becoming a lawyer, I hope to one day have involvement in the government and have more say on what happens in the government and the differrent laws put into pratice. Through this involvementment in the community I hope to target and help the latino population being underrepresented in the United States. My goal is to get more of the latino community into higher education, and show that everything and everything is possible through obtaining a higher education. </p>

  <h2 style="color:maroon"> Balfour Scholars Program</h2>
  <p>The Balfour Scholars Program was hosted at Indiana University Bloomington and introduced Scholars to the social aspects of college life and showed them the student clubs, campus events, and cultural activities that college has to offer. It was a wonderful experience, and I definetely am happy I was provided with the opporunity of attending such program, which gave me an insight into college life.</p>

  <h2 style="color:maroon">Hispanic Scholarship Fund Youth Leaderhip Institute at UCHicago</h2>
  <p>The Youth Leadership Institute (YLI) is a four-day, overnight, college empowerment conference for 150 Latino high school juniors.  It is designed to give young leaders the practical tools they need to successfully apply to top universities, have full access to scholarship and financial aid opportunities, and set a course for academic and career success. I not only enhanced my leadership abilities, alongside the other participants, but also expanded our professional networks by participating in college and career workshops, living on a college campus, and interacting with college students and professionals who served as our mentors.</p>

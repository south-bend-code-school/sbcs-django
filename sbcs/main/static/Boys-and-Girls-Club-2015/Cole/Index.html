<h2>
About Me:
</h2>

<p>
  I am a senior at Penn High School. I love to work at my jobs. I am very good
  at making pizza and I use to play baseball until I got hurt. I work grounds
  crew for multiple baseball fields around the area to stay in touch with the
  sport. I am a huge Green Bay Packers fan.
</p>
<h2>
How we Can Make Our Community Better:
</h2>
<p>
  Our community would be better if everyone came together as a whole and acted
  against the bad. This would include reporting crime, picking up trash on the
  streets, and protecting others. It would be awesome if we turned South Bend
  into a communicating city.
</p>
<h2>
When I Have Felt Apart of a Community:
</h2>
<p>
  I feel apart of my community when I go to school. This is because I go to
  school with friends that I have known since I first started grade school. I
  feel like we all go there every day for the same reason, so we all help out
  in keeping it nice and continue to learn how to communicate with one another.
</p>
<h2>
When I Have Felt Left Out of a Community:
</h2>
<p>
  I have felt left out of a community when I've been in a situation where I do
  not know anyone around me. Everyone interacted with one another except for
  myself, so I felt as if I did not have a part in the community.
</p>
<h2>
Technology to Me Means...
</h2>
<p>
  the future and how we will eventually make everything easier. We can use
  technology to help deal with every day problems that everyone faces, no matter
  who you are or where you come from.

  <h1 class="whatI"> WHAT I LOVE! </h1>
  <div><p> I love to play basketball. I Use to play for MBA Select from 4th grade
 to 8th grade, with that team we where state champs four years in a row
and we placed 4th in the nation in 2014. I've been playing basketball since I was 5
years old, and since then I've been playing and I love the game. Another thing I
love to do is Hair. Thats something I want to do for a living, Its something that
makes me happy. Doing something for someone else and making them feel good is the
best feeling anyone could have and thats one im going to keep doing.</p></div>

  when I was at my worst. Im with them 24/7 and they are my family and because of my family I am who I am

  <h1 class="whatI"> ISSUES I CARE ABOUT </h1>
  <div class= "violence"><p> Violence is the main issue I care about because where im from it is
    hard for young adults to walk around the city comfertable. Everyone is to
    caught up in what side of town they bang or what gang their in, most kids
    these days are blessed to even reach 18. I know many of people my age that
    have been shot, stabbed and robbed from people that are their so called "friends."
    Loyalty is everything when it comes to the streets, but how can you be loyal
    to something that changes everyday. </p></div>

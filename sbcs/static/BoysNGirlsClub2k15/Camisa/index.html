    All About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am 15 years old. My favorite color is light blue. I'm from Indiana attending Clay High School where I take a lot of honors classes, play the drums, and play varsity basketball.
    I loves sports, computers, and hanging with my two best friends, Emily and Macaela.

<h2>
  What would make my community better?
</h2>
<p>
  My coummunity would better when everyone can feel safe and go for a walk down the street without having to feel scared of violence in the city.

<h2>
  When have I felt like a part of my community?
</h2>
<p>
  Up in Indiana, things can get pretty cold during the winter months, and sometimes the bus wouldn't come. So how would i get to school?
  Well, the only other way would be by car.
  So on a day where the bus wouldn't come to get us, my mom, along with the other parents in the neighborhood, would all take turns car pulling the neighborhood kids to school.
  Luckily, we all went to the same school.

<h2>
  When have i felt left out of a community?
</h2>
<p>
  When i first got in to high school, I didnt know anyone. All of my friends and I from middle school, all went to differet high schools.
  On the first day, I was overwhelmed by all the new faces I saw.
  But after a while, I made friends.

<h2>
  To me, technology means...
</h2>
<p>
  Technology means a easier way of living. It limits the amount of labor that we have to do in our everyday lives.
   But it's also a great way to allow us to have fun in a completely new way.
   A way that the world has never seen before.

  I love watching this group dance!!! Which is kind of ironic, considering the fact that I cannot dance.
